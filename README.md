# SNES9x Music Toggle Mod

This is a fairly simple SNES9x fork to add a Music Toggle feature for Super Mario World and most Super Mario World Romhacks, useful for streaming with your own music!

This was thrown together in a few hours and is super messy, probably has a few bugs.

# ENGINES: 
* Vanilla - Mario World and hacks that use the regular Vanilla Sound Engine. Use this if there's no custom music in the hack.
* AddMusicK - A popular custom sound driver for Mario World. Use this if hack has custom music or Vanilla isn't working right.
